# Brock Beldham's Dotfiles
My take on a dotfiles repo. Things I use on a daily basis. Thanks to [mathiasbynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens) and his [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles). He left this note at the top of the README: 
> If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!`

So I did just that.
